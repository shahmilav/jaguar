** Incoming changes and features for Jaguar.
Pull requests welcome.

- [ ] Make site mobile responsive.
  Currently the site is not mobile responsive. Navigation gets hidden on mobile viewports, and cannot be accessed.
  The plan is to look at [[https://milavblog.netlfiy.app][my blog]], which has a mobile responsive navbar.
- [ ] Read from ~application.properties~.
  Currently sensitive information is hardcoded in ~DBManager.java~. We need to have the application instead from our ~application.properties~ file.

    - Sign in with Google
- [ ] Sign in with Google functionality.
  To be viable in today's world, Jaguar needs to have sign-in with Google functionality for a one click login and signup. Furthermore, sign in with Github and Apple would also be appreciated but have a lower priority.
